Rogue

	Abilities

	-	Poisoned Dagger

			The default attack of a rogue. It deals a small amount of damage, but applies a guaranteed
			condition on hit. Becomes more dangerous as conditions are applied. Can be used while lurking or
			hidden.
			
			[(5 * (random # out of 100 + power) / defense) + # of conditions ]

	-	Lurk / Backstab

			Using lurk makes the hero impossible to hit for one turn (hidden). While the hero is
			lurking, this ability transforms into 'Backstab', which gains power the longer it
			goes unused. Backstab always succeeds.
			
			[(5 + 2 * number of turns) * (random # out of 100 + power) / defense]

	-	Blinding Powder

			Lowers the attack of enemies, persisting for the remainder of combat. Has a slight chance at
			applying conditions. Best used against enemies with powerful but innacurate moves to
			reduce the chance of being defeated in a single blow.
			
			[attack - 20%] , [chance to apply condition = 50%]
