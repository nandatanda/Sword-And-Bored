-- ATTACK & PROTECC! : A TALE OF TWO LULZ --

-  [Narrator]	: "Shit happens, and because you are an RPG hero, it usually happens to you. Then again, no one really
                   asked you to play this thing anyway, right?. You can still alt + f4, if you're starting to get the
                   feeling that the game doesn't actually have any content. I won't deny it."

                  "I'm fairly certain that's a goblin behind you, by the way."

-  [Goblin]     : "Reeeeeeeeeeee!"

-  [Narrator]   : "This is stage 1, scene 2. This phase will contain info and dialogue intended for after combat.
                   If there is no after combat dialogue, this will be left blank.

-  [Narrator]   : "This is stage 2, scene 1."
